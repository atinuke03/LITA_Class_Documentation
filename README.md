# LITA_Project

## Project Title: LITA_Class_Documentation

Project overview
[Data Analysis](#data-analysis)

## Project Overview
```
This project aims to document learnings from data analysis classes.This is to track progress and performance.

## Tool used
```
- Microsoft Excel [Download here](https://www.microsoft.com) is used for:
  1. Data cleaning
  2. Analysis
  3. Data visualization

- Structured Query Language is used for quering of data
- Github is used for portfolio building

### Importance of Data Analysis
```
This involves exploring of the data to answer some questions about the status of a business such as;
 - What is working
 - What is not working
 - What we should focus on

## Data cleaning and Preparation
```
At the initial phase of data cleaning and preparation, the following actions was performed:
   - Data loading and inspection
   - Handling missing variables
   - Data cleaning and formatting

### Data Entry Fundamentals and Formatting 
 Basic data entry and shortcuts was performed in excel for efficiency. This includes; 
  - Data validation: This is used for placing a bound or restrictions over errors input in a cell. The shortcut for data validation is alt AVV
  - Control Spacebar: This is used to highlight the entire column in a worksheet
  - Shift Spacebar: This is used to highlight the entire row in a worksheet

### Basic Excel Functions
The excel functions helps to manage conditions. This includes
 -SUM: used for aggreagte in a column 
 -AVERAGE: used to acheive the average 
 -MAXIMUM : used to achieve the highest in a cell
 -MINIMUM: used to acheive the lowest in a cell
 -COUNT: used to count columns with numbers. 
 -COUNTA- used to count colums with text or combination of text and numbers
 -LARGE- handles different positions. It has two argument (Array and K). Array is a list of numbers used to find the largest within, while K is the position (e.g 3rd or 4th)
 -SUMIF/SUMIFS: The SUMIF is used for singular condition/criteria while SUMIFS is used for a number of criteria
 -AVERAGEIF/AVERAGEIFS: The AVERAGEIF is used for singular condition/criteria while AVERAGEIFS is used for a number of criteria
 -MAXIF/MAXIFS: The MAXIF is used for singular condition/criteria while MAXIFS is used for a number of criteria
 -MINIF/MINIFS: The MINIF is used for singular condition/criteria while MINIFS is used for a number of criteria
 -COUNTIF/COUNTIFS

### Data Analysis
```
This is where some basic lines of codes or queries and some of the DAX expressions were used during data analysis

```SQL
SELECT * FROM TABLE1
WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
```

### Data Visualization
