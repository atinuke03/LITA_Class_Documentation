- Microsoft Excel [Download here](https://www.microsoft.com) is used for:
  1. Data cleaning
  2. Analysis
  3. Data visualization

- Structured Query Language is used for quering of data
- Github is used for protfolio building 

## Data cleaning and Preparation
```
At the initial phase of data cleaning and preparation, the following actions was performed:
   - Data loading and inspection
   - Handling missing variables

### Data Entry Fundamentals and Formatting 
 Basic data entry and shortcuts was performed in excel for efficiency. This includes;

EDA involved the exploring of the data to answer some questions about data such as;
 - What is working?
 - What is not working?
 - What we should focus on?
### Data Analysis
```
This is where some basic lines of codes or queries and some of the DAX expressions were used during data analysis
