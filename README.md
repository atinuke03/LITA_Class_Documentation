## Project Title: LITA_Class_Documentation

Project overview
[Data Analysis](#data-analysis)

## Project Overview
```
This project aims to document learnings from data analysis classes.This is to track progress and performance.

## Tool used
```
- Microsoft Excel [Download here](https://www.microsoft.com) is used for:
  1. Data cleaning
  2. Analysis
  3. Data visualization

- Structured Query Language is used for quering of data
- Github is used for portfolio building

### Importance of Data Analysis
```
This involves exploring of the data to answer some questions about the status of a business such as;
 - What is working
 - What is not working
 - What we should focus on

## Data cleaning and Preparation
```
At the initial phase of data cleaning and preparation, the following actions was performed:
   - Data loading and inspection
   - Handling missing variables
   - Data cleaning and formatting

### Data Entry Fundamentals and Formatting 
 Basic data entry and shortcuts was performed in excel for efficiency. This includes; 
  - Data validation: This is used for placing a bound or restrictions over errors input in a cell. The shortcut for data validation is alt AVV
  - Control Spacebar: This is used to highlight the entire column in a worksheet
  - Shift Spacebar: This is used to highlight the entire row in a worksheet

### Basic Excel Functions
The excel functions helps to manage conditions. This includes
  1. SUM: used for aggreagte in a column 
  2. AVERAGE: used to acheive the average 
  3. MAXIMUM : used to achieve the highest in a cell
  4. MINIMUM: used to acheive the lowest in a cell
  5. COUNT: used to count columns with numbers. 
  6. COUNTA- used to count colums with text or combination of text and numbers
  7. LARGE- handles different positions. It has two argument (Array and K). Array is a list of numbers used to find the largest within, while K is the position (e.g 3rd or 4th)
  8. SUMIF/SUMIFS: The SUMIF is used for singular condition/criteria while SUMIFS is used for a number of criteria
  9. AVERAGEIF/AVERAGEIFS: The AVERAGEIF is used for singular condition/criteria while AVERAGEIFS is used for a number of criteria
  10. MAXIF/MAXIFS: The MAXIF is used for singular condition/criteria while MAXIFS is used for a number of criteria
  11. MINIF/MINIFS: The MINIF is used for singular condition/criteria while MINIFS is used for a more than one criterion
  12. COUNTIF/COUNTIFS: The COUNTIF is used for singular condition/criteria while COUNTIFS is used for a number of criteria

### Text Extraction
-Data extraction was taught and the following functions was explored:
  1. LEFT: is used for extraction from the left of the original text
  2. MID: is used for extraction from the mid of the original text
  3. RIGHT: is used for extraction from the right of the original text
  4. SEARCH & FIND: are two helper functions used alongside for the extraction

-To manage cases in excel, three functions are used and they include
  1. LOWER: is used to manage lower cases   
  2. UPPER: is used to manage upper cases
  3. PROPER: is used to manage the initial to be capital and the other cases small  letters
  4. TRIM: is used to eliminate excesses or unnecessary space in between text and words.

-Lookup Functions in excel helps to find specific data within a range or table. The functions in lookup include;
  1. VLOOKUP: Looks up values in a table and return a value from a specific column. It can return an approximate match
  2. Hlookup: Looks up values in a table and return a value from a specific row. It can return an approximte match
  3. INDEX/MATCH: Looks up values in a range or table and returns a value from any range. It can  return an approximate match.
  4. LOOKUP: Looks up values in a table and returns a value from the same table.


### Data Analysis
```
This is where some basic lines of codes or queries and some of the DAX expressions were used during data analysis

```SQL
SELECT * FROM TABLE1
WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
```

### Data Visualization
